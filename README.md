Can attach companion applications to League of Legends and Valorant (e.g. U.GG, Porofesser, blitz.gg) that launch and close with the games

Enables Riot Client to be force closed when a game is closed so it isn't always running in the background

## Installation

Download the latest .pext file from releases and open it using Playnite

## Usage

Upon installing the addon, refresh game library. The addon should auto-detect any existing installations of Riot Games properties.

Open the Riot Games settings under the addons menu to select the executables for your companion apps and choose if they should or shouldn't close with their related games.
